## Software for Understanding Gamma-Ray Pair Regime Polarimetry
### A Python MEGAlib extension for gamma-ray pair regime polarimetry
Python scripts designed to build off of existing MEGAlib software to perform analysis on polarized gamma rays undergoing pair production in a detector. Currently, this is specifically applied to the AMEGO-X geometry but parameters can be changed to adapt to different geometries.
